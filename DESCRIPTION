Description: Performs inferences from Generalized Linear Models fitted to
    cluster correlated data, using adjustment to the independence 
    loglikelihood developed in Chandler and Bate (2007) 
    <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015>.  The adjustment are performed by the 
    'chandwich' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=chandwich>.
